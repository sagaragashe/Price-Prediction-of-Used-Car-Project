**Libraries**

NumPy: NumPy is a library for scientific computing with Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, along with a large collection of mathematical functions that operate on these arrays. NumPy is essential for any machine learning project, including car price prediction.
   
Pandas: Pandas is a library for data analysis and manipulation with Python. It provides high-level data structures and operations for working with tabular data in Python. Pandas is another essential library for car price prediction, as it allows you to easily clean, prepare, and analyze your data.

Scikit-learn : Scikit-learn is a machine learning library for Python. It provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Scikit-learn is the most popular machine learning library for Python, and it is widely used in car price prediction projects.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a library for data visualization in Python. It provides a wide range of tools for creating charts and graphs. Matplotlib is useful for car price prediction projects, as it allows you to visualize your data and identify patterns.

Flask: A free, open-source Python web framework. It is known for its simplicity and flexibility.
