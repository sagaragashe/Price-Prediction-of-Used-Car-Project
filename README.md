# Price-Prediction-of-Used-Car-Project

The project will develop a machine learning model to predict the price of used cars. The model will be trained on a large dataset of historical used car sales data and evaluated on a held-out test set. The model will then be deployed to production so that it can be used by users to predict the price of used cars. 

**The objectives of the project are as follows:**

•	To develop an efficient and effective model which predicts the price of a used car according to user’s inputs.  

•	To develop a model that saves time for both buyers and sellers.

•	To develop a web application and takes input from the user and predicts the price.

•	The model that is being built must be feature based i.e., feature wise prediction must be possible. 


**Requirements**


**Software**

1.	Jupyter Notebook - Jupyter Notebook is a powerful tool that can be used to create a wide variety of web applications. It is a good choice for developers who want to create web applications. It is a web-based interactive development environment (IDE) for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations and visualizations.

2.	Anaconda Navigator - It is a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing Anaconda packages, environments, and channels. It is included with the Anaconda distribution, but it can also be installed separately.


**Libraries**

**NumPy:** 

**Pandas:**

**Scikit-learn :** 

**Matplotlib:** 

**Flask:**
